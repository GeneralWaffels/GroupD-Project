apparently GUI is better in C++? note


USE git for code contributions


doing steganography program in C
goal is to at least allow a few different files types
perhaps at least 2 methods including least significant bit



risks



requirements

task splitting

split methods of accepting different file types?

split the two encryption methods?

marking scheme:

final mark of this assignment is out of 100
20 is work in workbook L1-4

80% is based of group project

of that 80

40 is team mark- each person gets the same mark
based off quality of work, documentation, etc

16% based off individual contributions
submit report outlining contributions

final 24% is individual code contribution
quality of code
quality of comments
submits, etc

takes file to hide, file to hide in, and outputs file that is combination of the two, in the case of images

encryption using least significant bit in the case
think about discrete cosine transform coefficients- hides data better than LSB

add on more types of files we can accept, output and more types of encryptions to use
