CREATING A DECYPTION KEY

If the bits are hidden inside another file SEQUENTIALLY, (assuming least significant bit), could the key be the starting pixel and the ending pixel that the file is hidden within, assuming an image is used to hide the file?
Could that be a vulnerability that we could fix? Hide the bits in an order that follows a formula of some sort, skipping bytes that don't fit the formula.
